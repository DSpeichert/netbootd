      # name must be given in traditional, non-devfs format (so e.g. /dev/sda
      # and not e.g. /dev/discs/disc0/disc).
      # For example, to use the first SCSI/SATA hard disk:

      # Depending on what software you choose to install, or if things go wrong
      # during the installation process, it's possible that other questions may
      # be asked. You can preseed those too, of course. To get a list of every
      # possible question that could be asked during an install, do an
      # installation, and then run these commands:
      #   debconf-get-selections --installer > file
      #   debconf-get-selections >> file

      #### Advanced options
      ### Running custom commands during the installation
      ## i386 Preseed Example
      # d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks
      # for attempts at buffer overflows or other exploits of the values of a
      # preconfiguration file like this one. Only use preconfiguration files from
      # trusted locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful,
      # here's a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer,
      # automatically.

      # This first command is run as early as possible, just after
      # preseeding is read.
      # d-i preseed/early_command command here

      # This command is run immediately before the partitioner starts. It may be
      # useful to apply dynamic partitioner preseeding that depends on the state
      # of the disks (which may not be visible when preseed/early_command runs).
      #d-i partman/early_command \
      #       string debconf-set partman-auto/disk "$(list-devices disk | head -n1)"

      # This command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is
      # still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it
      # directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install
      # packages and run commands in the target system.
